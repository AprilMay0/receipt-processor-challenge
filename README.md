# Fetch Receipt Processor Challenge

This project implements a web server that fulfills the API requirements outlined in https://github.com/fetch-rewards/receipt-processor-challenge

## Getting Started

To run the application, execute the following command from the root directory:

```
go run .
```

This will start the server and expose the API endpoints as described in the challenge documentation.

## Future Improvements

If I were to continue work on this project, I would add comprehensive unit tests to validate various receipt processing scenarios to thoroughly test each rule. Currently, the endpoints have been manually tested using Thunder Client.

## Conclusion

Thank you for reviewing my submission. The provided documentation was clear and detailed, which made it straightforward to implement a working solution. I enjoyed working on this challenge and look forward to further discussions.
